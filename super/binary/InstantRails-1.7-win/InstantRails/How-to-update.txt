How To Upgrade
==============

The goal of upgrading, obviously, is to install a new version of
Instant Rails without losing any of your data or customizations.
Through this howto I will use '...' in directory paths represent
the base installation path for both the old and new versions of
Instant Rails.


Installing the New Instant Rails
================================

    * Unzip the new Instant Rails archive into a *new* directory.
      Do not overwrite your existing installation.

    * Copy your database files to the new installation by copying
      the entire contents of "...\mysql\data".

    * If you have may have modified a number of configuration files,
      so you'll want to copy those to the new installation:

          o Apache -- copy "...\conf_files\httpd.conf"
          o MySQL? -- copy "...\conf_files\my.ini"
          o PHP -- copy "...\conf_files\php.ini"

    * Copy your Rails web applications to the new installation by
      copying the entire contents of "...\rails_apps".

    * Start up Instant Rails to force the configuration files to be
      updated with the correct paths.


Updating Your Rails Applications
================================

The way SCGI_Rails is implemented has changed. In Instant Rails preview2,
the SCGI Rails Runner ("scgi_rails") was physically placed in your app's
"public" subdirectory, and a startup cmd file ("start_scgi.cmd") was placed
in your app's root directory.

Starting with preview3 all SCGI Rails Runner code is in "...\ruby\bin"
and there is no longer a "start_scgi.cmd" file. Instead, there is an
"scgi.yaml" configuration file in you app's "config" subdirectory. The
configuration file contains all the infomrtaion that SCGI Rails Runner
needs to serve up your app (like the port number to use, and whether to
run in development, production, or test mode).

You must create this SCGI configuration file for each of your Rails
apps since it won't already exist:

    * Select the menu command
      "Rails Applications >> Manage Rails Applications..."

    * For each Rails application, select it and press the button
      "Configure SCGI Settings..."

          o This will popup a dialog that will let you set the
            runtime mode (development, production, test) and the
            SCGI port number.

Instant Rails preview3 uses Ruby on Rails 1.0 Release Candidate 3 (aka 0.14.2).
If your Rails app was created with Rails 0.13.1, then you'll need to update the
Rails files in each of you apps:

    * Select the menu command "Rails Applications >> Open Ruby Console Window".
      One at a time, move into the base directory for each of your Rails apps,
      and then follow the upgrade instratuctions here:
      http://documentation.rubyonrails.com/release_notes/upgrading_from_0131_to_10.html

    * While you are in each of your app's base directory, you can also delete
      the obsolete SCGI files:

          o delete "...\rails_apps\your-app-name\start_scgi.cmd"
          o delete "...\rails_apps\your-app-name\public\scgi_rails"


You're Done!
============

That's it. You can move your new Instant Rails directory anywhere you'd like it to be. I would recomment keeping your old Instant Rails installation around until you are sure that everything is working correctly.
