2004-11-08 Curt:

2004-08-31 17:47 CURT

* Fixed build script to download and build FreeRIDE
from the tarball (I hacked in the FreeRIDE build earlier).

* Added a registry entry that allows you to right click
in windows explorer and select "New>Ruby Program" to create
and empty ruby file.

2004-08-17 13:51 CURT

* Compiled with vc++ 7.1 (required for FreeRIDE debugger)

* Added FreeRIDE 0.7.0 (prerelease)

* Changed TCL/TK support by compileing Ruby
  with the --enable-tcltk_stubs option, and
  eliminated the need to set any TCL environment
  variables.
  
* Upgraded Ruby-odbc to version 0.994

2004-07-30 13:51 CURT

* Built from Ruby 1.8.2 preview2

2004-07-29 08:29 CURT

* Built from Ruby 1.8.2 preview1

* Added Start Menu shortcuts to documentation on ruby-doc.org.

* Fixed IRB so that tab completion would work by picking up the
  Windows port of readline.dll and readline.so (v4.3.2) from
  ActiveScriptRuby 1.8.1.2 (http://arton.hp.infoseek.co.jp/).
  Copies of these files are now in the directory:
     ...\installer\local\irb-readline-4.3.2
  However, tab completion only works for english keyboards.
     
* Eliminated the installer dialog message that warned you might
  need to reboot your system. This was only true on older versions
  of Windows 98, and prevented an unattended install. For the record,
  an unattended install can be performed using the following command
  line arguments to the installer:
      /S /D=<install dir>     

2004-07-21 12:48 curt

* Changed the layout of the Windows registry entries. 

* Minor fixes in preparation for 182-14

* Upgraded Expat to version 1.95.7

* Upgraded Ruby-odbc to version 0.993

* Upgraded DBI to 0.23

* Upgraded FXRuby to version 1.0.29

2004-05-04 22:17 curt

* Log4R, as distributed in Ruby 1.8.1 had a known error that prevented
  it from being used in even simple cases (reported as bug #552). A fix
  had been posted to ruby-talk:

    http://blade.nagaokaut.ac.jp/cgi-bin/scat.rb/ruby/ruby-talk/80495

  I applied this fix and added it to our 181 patch.

2004-04-30 23:55  curt

* Created a Patch-181 directory that contains the ri database and
  win32ole patches for this release. These patch files must be manually copied
  to the "stable" directory *after* the build, and *before* running
  NSIS.

2004-04-30 23:50  curt

* Pulled the win32ole out of 181-10 as a tempoary workaround to
   win32ole being broken in the official 1.8.1 release.

2004-04-25 23:35  curt

* Hand generated the ri database from a post 1.8.1 Ruby snapshot
  (because ri in the Ruby 1.8.1 release tarball was broken).

* Fixed the bad paths in the *.bat files in ruby\bin.

2004-04-01 22:52  curt

* I had to back out my 2004-03-30 change where I removed the installer
  directory. It containsn ruby_env.exe which must be executed to set
  enviroment vars (some day I want to get rid of this program because
  we should be able to do this from the NSIS script).

2004-03-31 23:00  curt

* Upgraded SciTE to the latest version (1.59), which includes support
  for YAML highlighting and Tools menu commands for Ruby syntax checking,
  code profiling, and irb.

2004-03-30 23:00  curt

* The Ruby Installer included and installed a copy of the ruby installer
  NSIS script and some (but not all) of the resources needed to build
  the installer. I removed this because it didn't server any purpose
  (it was incomplete and people can get the ruby installer off of
  rubyforge if they ant it).

 * Fix the problem where "irb.bat", "erb.bat" and "rdoc.bat" had the
   wrong path in them.

2004-03-29 22:34  curt

* I created the file ...\installer\ChangeLog.txt (this file) to log
  all changes made to the Ruby Installer. Many of these changes are
  relevant only to those of us who are working on the installer.

  Changes the are relevant to the end-user of the Ruby Installer
  should be copied to ...\installer\stable\ReleaseNotes notice that
  there is *no* ".txt" extension). The content of this file is copied
  to ReleaseNotes.txt during the build.

* You can now specify a proxy server to be used for the downloads by
  setting the environment variable "http_proxy", like this:
     set http_proxy=http://myproxy:8080/

* You skip building the RI Database by setting this environment variable:
     set build_ri=false
  Buiding the RI Database is very time consuming, and temporarily disabling
  this can be used to speed up the edit-build-debug cycle.

* I renamed the README file to ReadMe.txt for make it easier to edit
  this file on windows (this *is* a windows installer, you know!  :-)

2004-03-28 18:50  curt

* The build process is now completely free of cygwin ans the NSIS
install script has been updated to work properly with NSIS 2.0 final.
