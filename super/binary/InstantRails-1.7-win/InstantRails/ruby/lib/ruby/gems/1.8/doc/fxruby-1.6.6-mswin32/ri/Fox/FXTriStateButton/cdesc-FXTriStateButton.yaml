  body: The tri-state button provides a three-state button, which toggles between the on and the off state each time it is pressed. Programmatically, it may also be switched into the <tt>MAYBE</tt> state. The <tt>MAYBE</tt> state is useful to signify an &quot;unknown&quot; or &quot;indeterminate&quot; state in the application data.
