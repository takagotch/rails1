- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: Adds the following methods for retrieval and query of a single associated object. <tt>association</tt> is replaced with the symbol passed as the first argument, so <tt>has_one :manager</tt> would add among others <tt>manager.nil?</tt>.
- !ruby/object:SM::Flow::LIST 
  contents: 
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::LI 
    label: "*"
    body: <tt>association(force_reload = false)</tt> - returns the associated object. Nil is returned if none is found.
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::LI 
    label: "*"
    body: <tt>association=(associate)</tt> - assigns the associate object, extracts the primary key, sets it as the foreign key, and saves the associate object.
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::LI 
    label: "*"
    body: <tt>association.nil?</tt> - returns true if there is no associated object.
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::LI 
    label: "*"
    body: "<tt>build_association(attributes = {})</tt> - returns a new object of the associated type that has been instantiated with <tt>attributes</tt> and linked to this object through a foreign key but has not yet been saved. Note: This ONLY works if an association already exists. It will NOT work if the association is nil."
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::LI 
    label: "*"
    body: <tt>create_association(attributes = {})</tt> - returns a new object of the associated type that has been instantiated with <tt>attributes</tt> and linked to this object through a foreign key and that has already been saved (if it passed the validation).

    label: "*"
    body: <tt>Account#beneficiary=(beneficiary)</tt> (similar to <tt>beneficiary.account_id = account.id; beneficiary.save</tt>)

    body: <tt>Account#beneficiary.nil?</tt>

  type: :BULLET
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: The declaration can also include an options hash to specialize the behavior of the association.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: "Options are:"
- !ruby/object:SM::Flow::LIST 
  contents: 
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::LI 
    label: "*"
    body: <tt>:class_name</tt> - specify the class name of the association. Use it only if that name can't be inferred from the association name. So <tt>has_one :manager</tt> will by default be linked to the <tt>Manager</tt> class, but if the real class name is <tt>Person</tt>, you'll have to specify it with this option.
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::LI 
    label: "*"
    body: <tt>:conditions</tt> - specify the conditions that the associated object must meet in order to be included as a &quot;WHERE&quot; sql fragment, such as &quot;rank = 5&quot;.
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::LI 
    label: "*"
    body: <tt>:order</tt> - specify the order from which the associated object will be picked at the top. Specified as
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::VERB 
    body: " an &quot;ORDER BY&quot; sql fragment, such as &quot;last_name, first_name DESC&quot;\n"
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::LI 
    label: "*"
    body: <tt>:dependent</tt> - if set to :destroy (or true) the associated object is destroyed when this object is. If set to :delete the associated object is deleted <b>without</b> calling its destroy method. If set to :nullify the associated object's foreign key is set to NULL. Also, association is assigned.
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::LI 
    label: "*"
    body: <tt>:foreign_key</tt> - specify the foreign key used for the association. By default this is guessed to be the name of this class in lower-case and &quot;_id&quot; suffixed. So a <tt>Person</tt> class that makes a has_one association will use &quot;person_id&quot; as the default foreign_key.
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::LI 
    label: "*"
    body: <tt>:include</tt> - specify second-order associations that should be eager loaded when this object is loaded.
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::LI 
    label: "*"
    body: "<tt>:as</tt>: Specifies a polymorphic interface (See #belongs_to)."
