  body: Returns a string of option tags for pretty much any country in the world. Supply a country name as <tt>selected</tt> to have it marked as the selected option tag. You can also supply an array of countries as <tt>priority_countries</tt>, so that they will be listed above the rest of the (long) list.

  body: "NOTE: Only the option tags are returned, you have to wrap this call in a regular HTML select tag."
