  body: Load pixel data from a stream.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: "Note that the base class version of #loadPixels expects to read the the pixel data in a neutral format (i.e. without any image format specific information). For example, if you have a 1024x768 image without an alpha channel (and thus only the red, green and blue channels), #loadPixels will attempt to read a total of 1024*768*3*8 bytes from the stream. The behavior of #loadPixels is different for subclasses such as FXPNGImage, where #loadPixels will instead expects to read the image data in a specific image file format (i.e. the PNG file format)."
