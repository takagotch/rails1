  body: "These are like their namesakes Home(Extend)?, LineEnd(Extend)?, VCHome(Extend)? except they behave differently when word-wrap is enabled: They go first to the start / end of the display line, like (Home|LineEnd)Display The difference is that, the cursor is already at the point, it goes on to the start or end of the document line, as appropriate for (Home|LineEnd|VCHome)(Extend)?."
