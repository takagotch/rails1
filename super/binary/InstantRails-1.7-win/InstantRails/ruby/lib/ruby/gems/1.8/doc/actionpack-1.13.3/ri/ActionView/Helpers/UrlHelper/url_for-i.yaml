- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: Returns the URL for the set of <tt>options</tt> provided. This takes the same options as url_for in action controller. For a list, see the documentation for ActionController::Base#url_for. Note that it'll set :only_path =&gt; true so you'll get the relative /controller/action instead of the fully qualified http://example.com/controller/action.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: When called from a view, url_for returns an HTML escaped url. If you need an unescaped url, pass :escape =&gt; false in the <tt>options</tt>.
