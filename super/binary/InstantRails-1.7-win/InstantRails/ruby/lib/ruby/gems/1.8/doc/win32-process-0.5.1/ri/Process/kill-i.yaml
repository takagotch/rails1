  body: Signal 0 merely tests if the process is running without killing it. Signal 2 sends a CTRL_C_EVENT to the process. Signal 3 sends a CTRL_BRK_EVENT to the process. Signal 9 kills the process in a harsh manner. Signals 1 and 4-8 kill the process in a nice manner.

  body: SIGINT/INT corresponds to signal 2 SIGBRK/BRK corresponds to signal 3 SIGKILL/KILL corresponds to signal 9
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P
