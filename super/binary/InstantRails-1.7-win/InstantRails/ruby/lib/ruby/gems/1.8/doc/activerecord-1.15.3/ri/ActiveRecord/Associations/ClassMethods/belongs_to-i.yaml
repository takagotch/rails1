- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: Adds the following methods for retrieval and query for a single associated object that this object holds an id to. <tt>association</tt> is replaced with the symbol passed as the first argument, so <tt>belongs_to :author</tt> would add among others <tt>author.nil?</tt>.
- !ruby/object:SM::Flow::LIST 
  contents: 
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::LI 
    label: "*"
    body: <tt>association(force_reload = false)</tt> - returns the associated object. Nil is returned if none is found.
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::LI 
    label: "*"
    body: <tt>association=(associate)</tt> - assigns the associate object, extracts the primary key, and sets it as the foreign key.
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::LI 
    label: "*"
    body: <tt>association.nil?</tt> - returns true if there is no associated object.
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::LI 
    label: "*"
    body: <tt>build_association(attributes = {})</tt> - returns a new object of the associated type that has been instantiated with <tt>attributes</tt> and linked to this object through a foreign key but has not yet been saved.
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::LI 
    label: "*"
    body: <tt>create_association(attributes = {})</tt> - returns a new object of the associated type that has been instantiated with <tt>attributes</tt> and linked to this object through a foreign key and that has already been saved (if it passed the validation).

    label: "*"
    body: <tt>Post#author</tt> (similar to <tt>Author.find(author_id)</tt>)
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::LI 
    label: "*"
    body: <tt>Post#author=(author)</tt> (similar to <tt>post.author_id = author.id</tt>)
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::LI 
    label: "*"
    body: <tt>Post#author?</tt> (similar to <tt>post.author == some_author</tt>)
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::LI 
    label: "*"
    body: <tt>Post#author.nil?</tt>
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::LI 
    label: "*"
    body: <tt>Post#build_author</tt> (similar to <tt>post.author = Author.new</tt>)
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::LI

    body: <tt>Post#create_author</tt> (similar to <tt>post.author = Author.new; post.author.save; post.author</tt>)
  type: :BULLET
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: The declaration can also include an options hash to specialize the behavior of the association.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: "Options are:"
- !ruby/object:SM::Flow::LIST 
  contents: 
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::LI 
    label: "*"
    body: <tt>:class_name</tt> - specify the class name of the association. Use it only if that name can't be inferred from the association name. So <tt>has_one :author</tt> will by default be linked to the <tt>Author</tt> class, but if the real class name is <tt>Person</tt>, you'll have to specify it with this option.
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::LI 
    label: "*"
    body: <tt>:conditions</tt> - specify the conditions that the associated object must meet in order to be included as a &quot;WHERE&quot; sql fragment, such as &quot;authorized = 1&quot;.
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::LI 
    label: "*"
    body: <tt>:order</tt> - specify the order from which the associated object will be picked at the top. Specified as an &quot;ORDER BY&quot; sql fragment, such as &quot;last_name, first_name DESC&quot;
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::LI 
    label: "*"
    body: <tt>:foreign_key</tt> - specify the foreign key used for the association. By default this is guessed to be the name of the associated class in lower-case and &quot;_id&quot; suffixed. So a <tt>Person</tt> class that makes a belongs_to association to a <tt>Boss</tt> class will use &quot;boss_id&quot; as the default foreign_key.
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::LI 
    label: "*"
    body: <tt>:counter_cache</tt> - caches the number of belonging objects on the associate class through use of increment_counter and decrement_counter. The counter cache is incremented when an object of this class is created and decremented when it's destroyed. This requires that a column named &quot;#{table_name}_count&quot; (such as comments_count for a belonging Comment class) is used on the associate class (such as a Post class). You can also specify a custom counter cache column by given that name instead of a true/false value to this option (e.g., <tt>:counter_cache =&gt; :my_custom_counter</tt>.)
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::LI 
    label: "*"
    body: <tt>:include</tt> - specify second-order associations that should be eager loaded when this object is loaded.
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::LI 
    label: "*"
    body: <tt>:polymorphic</tt> - specify this association is a polymorphic association by passing true.

  body: "  belongs_to :firm, :foreign_key =&gt; &quot;client_of&quot;\n  belongs_to :author, :class_name =&gt; &quot;Person&quot;, :foreign_key =&gt; &quot;author_id&quot;\n  belongs_to :valid_coupon, :class_name =&gt; &quot;Coupon&quot;, :foreign_key =&gt; &quot;coupon_id&quot;,\n             :conditions =&gt; 'discounts &gt; #{payments_count}'\n  belongs_to :attachable, :polymorphic =&gt; true\n"
