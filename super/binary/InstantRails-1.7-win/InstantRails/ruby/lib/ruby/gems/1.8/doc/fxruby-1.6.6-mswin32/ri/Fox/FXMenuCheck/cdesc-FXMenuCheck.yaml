  body: The FXMenuCheck widget is used to change a state in the application from a menu. Menu checks may reflect the state of the application by graying out, becoming hidden, or by a check mark. When activated, a menu check sends a <tt>SEL_COMMAND</tt> message to its target; the message data contains the new state (one of <tt>TRUE</tt>, <tt>FALSE</tt> or <tt>MAYBE</tt>).
