- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: The preferred method of outputting text in your views is to use the &lt;%= &quot;text&quot; %&gt; eRuby syntax. The regular <em>puts</em> and <em>print</em> methods do not operate as expected in an eRuby code block. If you absolutely must output text within a code block, you can use the concat method.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::VERB 
  body: "  &lt;% concat &quot;hello&quot;, binding %&gt;\n"
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: "is equivalent to using:"
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::VERB
