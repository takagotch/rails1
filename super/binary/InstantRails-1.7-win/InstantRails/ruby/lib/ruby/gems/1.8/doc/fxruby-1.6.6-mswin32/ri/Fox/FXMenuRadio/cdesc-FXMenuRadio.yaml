  body: The FXMenuRadio widget is used to change a state in the application from a menu. Menu radio commands may reflect the state of the application by graying out, becoming hidden, or by displaying a bullet. When activated, a menu radio sends a <tt>SEL_COMMAND</tt> to its target; the message data contains the new state. A collection of menu radio widgets which belong to each other is supposed to be updated by a common <tt>SEL_UPDATE</tt> handler to properly maintain the state between them.
