  body: Replace the target text with the argument text after \d processing. Text is counted so it can contain NULs. Looks for \d where d is between 1 and 9 and replaces these with the strings matched in the last search operation which were surrounded by \( and \). Returns the length of the replacement text including any change caused by processing the \d patterns.
