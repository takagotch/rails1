  body: The Icon Dictionary manages a collection of icons. The icons are referenced by their file name. When first encountering a new file name, the icon is located by searching the icon search path for the icon file. If found, the services of the icon source object are used to load the icon from the file. A custom icon source may be installed to furnish support for additonal image file formats. Once the icon is loaded, an association between the icon name and the icon is entered into the icon dictionary. Subsequent searches for an icon with this name will be satisfied from the cached value. The lifetype of the icons is managed by the icon dictionary, and thus all icons will be deleted when the dictionary is deleted.
