- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: Yields an EventLogStruct every time a record is written to the event log, once every <tt>frequency</tt> seconds. Unlike EventLog#notify_change, this method does not break out of the block after the event. The read <tt>frequency</tt> is set to 5 seconds by default.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: Raises an EventLogError if no block is provided.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: The delay between reads is due to the nature of the Windows event log. It is not really designed to be tailed in the manner of a Unix syslog, for example, in that not nearly as many events are typically recorded. It's just not designed to be polled that heavily.
